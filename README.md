## How?
> How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?  
> How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?  
> How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?  
> Oh no, oh no  
>
> You know life can be long
> You've got to be so strong
> And the world she is tough
> Sometimes I feel I've had enough
